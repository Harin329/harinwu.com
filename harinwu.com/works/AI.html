              <p class="post-title">June 2020 - July 2020: Machine Learning @ UBC</p>
              <p>Learning from an advanced machine learning course, I was able to implement my own algorithms at low
                levels. We analyzed
                decision trees, naive bayes, knn, ensemble methods, random forests, kmeans, DBSCAN, hierarchical,
                regression, gradient descent,
                RBF, perceptron, SVM, stochastic gradient, various boosting methods, MLE, MAP, PCA, matrix
                factorization, dimension reduction,
                compression, convolutional neural networks. I finished the 2nd in the final class <a
                  href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/cs340s20final">Kaggle competition</a>, with my neural network.
              </p>
              </p>

              <p class="post-title">May 2020: Reinforcement Learning</p>
              <p>Learning from Open AI contributions and breakthrough research papers,
                I explored state of the art model-free algorithms like Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), Deep
                Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG), Vanilla Policy Gradient (VPG),
                Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO), Twin Delayed DDPG (TD3), Soft Actor Critic (SAC), Deep Q
                Network (DQN), Advantage Actor Critic (Async + Sync) (A2C/A3C)
                and model-based algoirthms like the famous Alpha Zero Monte Carlo Search Tree (MCST). I not only
                explored each algorithm, but also their benefits, use cases and implementation.

              <p class="post-title">Apr 2020: StockChek</p>
              <p>An exploration of Long Short Term Memory for time series forecast, notably within the stock market.
                Many iterations of neural networks with various parameters and setups were attempted. Moderate
                short-term portfolio gain
                was achieved when paired with market knowledge. Private Github upon

              <p>An exploration of supervised algorithms like K-nearest neighbour, the basics of machine learning.
                The algorithm attempts to predict final hockey scores based on statistics from the first two periods. <a

              <p class="post-title">Nov 2018: Fruit AI</p>
              <p>With the booming age of AI and machine learning, I wanted to differentiate myself from everyone
                throwing the term around as a buzzword.
                This is where I opened Pandora's box to this field.
                Realizing I have much to learn, I created a simple application which identifies objects with the device
                camera using Appleâ€™s Inception V3 dataset.
                This was a big step for me, as I introduced myself to the workings of machine learning, model creation
                procedures and
                debunked the myths of a magic machine that will solve everything. Archived Github upon request.
