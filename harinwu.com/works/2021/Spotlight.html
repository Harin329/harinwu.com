              <p class="post-title">Inspiration:</p>
              <p>The experience of enjoying music is deeply personal, but it doesn’t have to be done in isolation.
                Current music streaming platforms like Spotify are very limited in allowing users to interact with one
                another—it is extremely difficult to discover new music that you actually like or stay up to date with
                your friends’ evolving music tastes.
                <br>
                <br>
                We identified the following problems to design our solution around:
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>Hidden gems</b> - Spotify only promotes Spotify-curated playlists, which are dominated only by top-paid
                artists. As a result, less popular artists do not get discovered. Low-played and low-payed tracks are
                forgotten and hidden, almost impossible to find unless users know exactly what to search.
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>Isolation</b> - Users are disconnected from each other, unable to meaningfully interact with one another on
                the platform. It is extremely difficult to stay up to date with your friends' evolving music tastes.
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>Ice breaker</b> - Friendships can be sparked by shared tastes in music—but there is no quick way to discover
                new users (and playlists) to follow on current music streaming platforms.
              </p>
              <p class="post-title">What it does:</p>
              <p>Spotlight is a music extension app for Spotify; We focus on highlighting the authentic experience of
                discovering by spotlighting real user’s musical footprints. From listeners to artists, people can
                discover and share their unique curated playlists while sparking new friendships through shared taste in
                music. Each of the three following key features is designed to tackle one aforementioned issue users
                encounter on current streaming platforms:
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>Discover</b> - Sick of listening to Top 50? Discover authentic user-generated playlists and new songs
                curated across the globe.
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>Community</b> - Interact with Spotify users like you never have before, and send music directly to your feed
                or private inbox!
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>Compatibility</b> - With compatibility scores, you can spark friendships by a shared taste in music. And
                yes, we promise, it’s better than Tinder.

              <p class="post-title">How we built it:</p>
              <p>
                This project was built with our first hackathon all-nighter. We were late on our ideation, finalizing
                our idea 4 hours into the hackathon. We then decided to use a trusty full stack setup: MySQL database,
                Python FastAPI server, and a Swift UI frontend iOS app. We also decided to include some unique technical
                features, including docker-compose and our unique hybrid ML model. We created a docker-compose set up to
                allow our two developers to share an identical dev environment, with an easy "docker-compose up" command
                to start the database and server. This also includes initialization of mock data, tables and stored
                procedures. The setup allowed us to explore various hosting options including Raspberry Pi/Jetson Nano
                (unfortunately we had no ethernet), and allowed us to ultimately deploy on GCP. We also built a
                recommendation engine that combines algorithms with human intelligence. The app discovers users similar
                to you through a cosine similarity algorithm, this data is then stored on our database for fast
                inference. The parameters used include variables like danceability, tempo, speechiness and 7 more, all
                extracted from Spotify. We then pull top playlists from these users from our database to ultimately
                provide a mixed recommendation for the user. In addition, we apply the same technique from a user to all
                the playlists in our database, providing a raw algorithmic suggestion.</p>
              <p class="post-title">Challenges we ran into:</p>
              <p>A big problem we had was in the final 8 hours of the competition. We started encountering many minor
                issues as we got tired, including minute details like missed semi-colon, typos, and our personal
                favorite: using the wrong email address in the dev console (denying us access for an hour). However,
                given the time constraint and difficult circumstances, our team was able to pull an all-nighter and
                complete the app before the deadline.</p>
              <p class="post-title">Accomplishments that we’re proud of:</p>
              <p>Pinnacle will be the last hackathon for all four of us, so we are really proud to get together and
                build one last time. </p>
              <p class="post-title">What's next for Spotlight:</p>
              <p>We plan to polish and release this app into full production, stay tuned!</p>
